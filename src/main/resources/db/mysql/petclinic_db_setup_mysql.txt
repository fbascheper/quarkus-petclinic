1) Download and install the MySQL database (e.g., MySQL Community Server 5.1.x),
   which can be found here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/. Or run the
   "docker-compose.yml" from the root of the project (if you have docker installed
   locally):

        $ docker-compose up
        ...
        mysql_1_eedb4818d817 | MySQL init process done. Ready for start up.
        ...

2) Create the PetClinic database and user by executing the "db/mysql/{schema,data}.sql"
   scripts (or set "spring.datasource.initialize=always" the first time you run the app).

3) Run the app with `spring.profiles.active=mysql` (e.g. as a System property via the command
   line, but any way that sets that property in a Spring Boot app should work).

N.B. the "petclinic" database has to exist for the app to work with the JDBC URL value
as it is configured by default. This condition is taken care of by the docker-compose
configuration provided, or by the `schema.sql` if you can run that as root.
