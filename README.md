### Introduction

This article will teach you the basics for building applications with Quarkus by converting code from 
the [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) to build a cloud native Quarkus 
application using 'the best of breed Java libraries and standards', such as Hibernate Panache, RestEasy and GraalVM.
